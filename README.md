# FGO Companion

This is a work in progress attempting to implement a companion app to go with the Fate/Grand Order mobile game.

There are two main features planned:

## Roster

Track your servants, your materials, QP, etc. View and filter your servants by rarity, material needed, and more.

## Calendar

Plan your farming and spending. Data for events is tracked and leveling and skilling servants can be planned in advance.

*Notes:*

This app will be implemented with python, with the GUI being created using either Kivy or QT Python.
